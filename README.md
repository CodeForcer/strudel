# Nathan's Strudel Playground

I know nothing about music, but how hard could it be?

## Songs

### We found love

- Chopped vocal samples from Rihanna "We found love" to 128bpm in G-flat Minor
- Layered in chord progressions in G-flat Minor for 2 instruments
- Created a transition effect using rising/falling whitenoise + percussion clap
- Invented a melody based on the 4 C Major common chords and transposed to G-flat Minor
- Basic arrangement style copied from EDM music (into, drop, breakdown, big drop, outro)
